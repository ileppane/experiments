        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        On each round, a black ball is dropped through a funnel into the light blue area.
        The ball will roll on a random location.

        Your task is to control the location of the funnel, by moving the red circle. You can move it by dragging it.
        Try to keep all black balls as close to the centre of the area as possible.

        Your score is a sum of the distances of each new black ball from the centre -- the smaller your score, the better.
