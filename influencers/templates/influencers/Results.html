                This challenge is an example of a <b>knapsack problem</b>, where there is a need to maximise
                the value of a collection of non-divisible items. Each item has value that contributes to the
                total value of the knapsack, and weight that contributes to the total weight.
                The name derives from the familiar problem of filling a knapsack when going for a holiday:
                the knapsack has a maximum allowed weight, and the user wants to maximise the total value of
                the packed items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Companies and decision makers face knapsack problems in resource allocation. For example, a
                new venture may have to select a set of business divisions to invest in such that the return
                on investment is maximised. The projects may have interdependencies, as with the
                digital marketing problem. In other words, if you include one project, this may dictate whether
                you also include or exclude another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knapsack problems are most often solved with dynamic programming algorithms, which decompose the
                problem into smaller sub-problems and solve these recursively. The digital marketing problem is a special
                case known as the <b>0-1 knapsack problem</b>, where the inclusion of an influencer is described with a binary
                variable (0 means exclude, 1 means include).
