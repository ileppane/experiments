<div class="instructions well well-lg">
<p>Your task is to make a number of decisions in a simple inventory management setting.</p>
<p>You are a retailer who sells a single (fictional) item at a specific price to customers. You order these items to an inventory before you can sell them. You order the items from the supplier at a specific unit cost and your customers will pay a specific unit price for them. You must make the order decision before you know how many items your customers will demand.</p>
<p>There is a certain demand for the items that you sell, but you know this demand only after making the order quantity decision. However, we present you the possible demand values.</p>
<p>This situation repeats in the same manner over many selling rounds. The nature of the items is such that you cannot carry them over to the next round.</p>
<p>The profit from your chosen order quantity depends on the realization of the demand. If the realized demand does not match your order quantity, there are two possibilities:
<ul>
    <li>The demand is higher than your order quantity; in this case you will disappoint some of your customers because you cannot deliver the items to them, and you will also lose any margin from those units of demand you could not satisfy.</li>
    <li>The demand is lower than your order quantity; in this case you satisfy your customers, but you have incurred costs for some units bought, without being able to earn revenue with these units.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to calculate the profits for each possible combination of order quantity and demand. We provide them to you with the following decision matrix:</p>

<br>

<div id="tabledata"></div>

<h2>Experimental protocol</h2>
<p>You will first answer to some test questions at the end of this page. Then you have to make order decisions in a number of rounds. After each decision, the computer randomly determines a demand realization.</p><p>As in Part 1, you should make sound decisions, because you will be rewarded according to them.</p>
<p><b>The decisions that you make are grouped in blocks</b>. The first five decision rounds are practice rounds that do not count towards your final monetary reward. After the practice rounds, there are two kinds of blocks: <b>Reappraise</b> blocks and <b>Attend</b> blocks. These 5-round blocks will appear to you in a random order, and there will be 4 blocks of each. Thus, you will complete a total of 40 decision rounds after the 5 practice rounds.</p>
<p>Below you see the instruction for the two kinds of blocks. These instructions are repeated again before the start of each block, i.e. after every 5 rounds.</p>
<h3>Attend block</h3>
<ul><i>{{ blockatt|safe }}</i></ul>
<h3>Reappraise block</h3>
<ul><i>{{ blockreap|safe }}</i></ul>

<h2>Reward determination</h2>
<p>At the end of the experiment the computer will calculate your average profit during the decision rounds (excluding the first 5 practice rounds). This average profit will then be divided by 10. This will be your monetary reward from Part 2 in pence (i.e. in £ 1/100). For example, if your average profit is 855, your monetary reward from this Part is 855/10 pence = £0.86 (rounded to the nearest whole pence).</p>
<p>In addition to your rewards from the tasks in Parts 1 and 2, you will receive a baseline reward of £{{ baselinereward }}.</p>
<h2>Test questions</h2>
<p>Please answer the following questions concerning the task. We want to make sure that you have understood the above instructions correctly.</p>
