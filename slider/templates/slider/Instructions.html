        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You represent a firm that sells products from an inventory to
        customers. Your only task is to make one decision during each round: how large to make your
        inventory. Below we explain how you make your decision and how the profits are determined.
    </p>

    <p><b>Inventory and demand.</b>
        Your inventory size is determined by the size of the blue circle. The larger you make the circle, the larger your inventory.
        The numerical value of your inventory size is a whole number between 1 and 300. You can think of this value as the number of
        products that you stock.

        <p>You can only sell the inventory that is demanded from you. Demand is determined after you have set your inventory size.
        Like inventory, demand is a value between 1 and 300.
        You can think of demand as the number of customers who visit your inventory to buy your products.</p>

        <p>If your inventory is not large enough to satisfy all demand, some customers will leave your inventory empty handed. On
        the other hand, if your inventory is larger than demand, you will have leftover products which do not bring you any profit. You cannot
        use the leftovers in the next periods.</p>

        <p>Demand is determined as the size of the demand circle, randomly drawn each round, numerically as a whole number between 1 and 300.
        Each value of demand has an equal probability of occurring. Each random draw of demand is independent of previous draws.</p>

        <p>You will know demand only after you have set your inventory circle size.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Revenue.</b>
        Your revenue will be determined by how much of your inventory you are able to sell to your customers. If the demand circle is larger
        than your inventory circle, then your revenue is determined only by your inventory circle. If the
        demand circle is smaller than your inventory circle, then your revenue is determined only by the size of the demand circle.
        Numerically, the customers will pay you 12 pence per each unit that is sold from the inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if your inventory circle size is 40, but your demand circle size is 60, then the extra demand of 20 will not be satisfied.
        In this case your revenue is 12 × 40 = 480 p. If the demand circle size turns out to be 30 instead of 60,
        your revenue is 12 × 30 = 360 p, and your leftover inventory is 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Ordering cost.</b>
        You have to pay {{ costparam }} pence for each unit that you order to the inventory. Note that due to the randomness of demand,
        it may be that your ordering cost will be higher than your revenue, resulting into losses.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Profit.</b> Your profit is calculated by subtracting ordering cost from revenue. Measured in pence (£ 1/100),
        profit is therefore:
    </p>

    <ul>
        If demand circle is smaller than inventory circle: <strong>12 × [demand] &minus; {{ costparam }} × [inventory]</strong><br>
        If demand circle is larger than inventory circle: <strong>12 × [inventory] &minus; {{ costparam }} × [inventory]</strong><br>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If lossess occur, these will be subtracted from your baseline reward.
    </p>

        <p>
        <b>Monetary reward.</b> You will be paid the average of the two profits that you get from this part and Part III,
        where you will be making a decision in a similar situation. For example, if your profit in this part is 90 pence
        and in Part III, 120 pence, your monetary reward is (0.90 + 1.20)/2 = £1.05. This will be added to your reward from Part I.
