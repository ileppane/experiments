<p>The purpose of this game is to understand stock behavior. The game evolves over several weeks.</p>
<p>Each week, there are customers who demand items from your stock. Each week, you can decide whether or not to make a replenishment order from your supplier.</p>
<p>On the first week you start with some initial level of stock.</p>
<p>Making replenishment orders is costly: you have to pay a fixed cost for each batch that you order.</p>
<p>Holding stock is also costly: you have to pay a variable cost of 40% of the item's value to hold it over the game.</p>
<p>If in some week your stock level is less than demand, you incur backlog that has to be satisfied from your next order.</p>
<p>Backlogs result in extra variable costs, such as reputational damage and goodwill losses.</p>
<p>Your service level indicates how often you have been able to immediately satisfy a customer demand. Service level is under 100% if you have incurred backlogs.</p>
