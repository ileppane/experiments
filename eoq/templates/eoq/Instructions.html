<p>The purpose of this game is to understand stock behavior. The game evolves over several weeks.</p>
<p>Each week, there are customers who demand items from your stock. Each week, you can decide whether or not to make a replenishment order.</p>
<p>The graph shows your stock level each week. On first week you have an initial level of stock.</p>
<p>Making a replenishment orders is costly: you have to pay a fixed cost for each batch that you order.</p>
<p>Holding stock is also costly: you have to pay a variable cost of 40% of the item's value to hold it over the game.</p>
<p>If in some week your stock level is less than demand, you incur backlog that has to be satisfied from your next order.</p>
<p>Backlogs result in extra costs on top of the standard ordering cost. This is because you will suffer reputation and goodwill losses from stockouts. Backlog ordering costs are 4-times the normal ordering cost.</p>
