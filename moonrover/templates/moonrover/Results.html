                This challenge is an example of an <b>optimal routing problem</b>, also known as the travelling salesman problem.
                Companies face routing problems mainly in logistics, where an optimal route must be designed between nodes in a network such that cost is minimised.
            </p>

            <p>
                Logistics companies such as Amazon have for long been planning to use drones as delivery vehicles, and the limited range of the drone
                poses a challenge for designing an optimal route for it. There are also ridesharing platforms in London and other large cities, where companies
                allow customers to rent vehicles and return them to selected locations ...
            </p>

            <p>
                Analytics can help in optimal routing problems by describing the problem as a network and using efficient algorithms to solve it.
