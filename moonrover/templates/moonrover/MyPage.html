    <p>International efforts in space exploration have discovered interesting
    sites in one of Jupiter's moons. The sites are shown in the map below.</p>

    <p>[insert map here]</p>

    <p>It has been decided that a moon rover is sent to the moon and it will
    be programmed to visit certain sites. Due to technical capabilities,
    it will be limited to visiting four sites in the moon. Furthermore,
        it can <b>only travel 10 km</b> before its battery runs out. Distance between
    the sites in the map above can be measured by geometric lines. Each square
    in the map is one-by-one kilometer in size.</p>

    <p>The space scientists have determined the value of each site that the
    moon rover may visit, as shown in the table below.</p>

    <table border="1" align="center" width="500px">
        <tr><th>	Site	</th><th>	Value of site	</th><th>	x-coordinate	</th><th>	y-coordinate	</th></tr>
        <tr><td>	Plains	</td><td>	1	</td><td>	9	</td><td>	7	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Boulder	</td><td>	1	</td><td>	8	</td><td>	4	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Rocks	</td><td>	2	</td><td>	8	</td><td>	1	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Cliffs	</td><td>	2	</td><td>	7	</td><td>	8	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Water	</td><td>	4	</td><td>	7	</td><td>	6	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Fossils	</td><td>	5	</td><td>	7	</td><td>	3	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Volcano	</td><td>	4	</td><td>	5	</td><td>	2	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Mountain	</td><td>	3	</td><td>	2	</td><td>	3	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Crater	</td><td>	3	</td><td>	1	</td><td>	8	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Electromagnetic	</td><td>	5	</td><td>	4	</td><td>	10	</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>The starting point has x-coordinate 4 and y-coordinate 6.</p>

    <p>What is the optimal route for the moon rover, so that the combined value
    of the sites visited is maximised? Input your answer below in the order in
    which to visit the sites.</p>
