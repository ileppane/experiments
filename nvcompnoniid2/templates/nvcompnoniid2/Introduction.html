    <p>
        You have been invited to participate in this study because you completed a similar study last week, as part of
        cohort 1 or cohort 2.
        In that study, you were asked to complete three decisions, all of which contributed towards your monetary reward.
        In this study, you will be asked to complete the final part of last week's study again.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the final part of the previous study, you decided upon an inventory order quantity in a situation that is
        described in the instructions below. You are free to revise the instructions now.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, we ask you to make that inventory order decision again. You are newly paired with another participant of
        today's study. All participants that we have invited for today's study took part in last week's study.
        Your monetary reward today will be the profit (in pence, Â£1/100) that you make from selling the units that
        you order to your inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>What is new this time?</b> We give market information from last week to all our participants.
        On the next page, you will
        see what were the inventory order quantities of your firm and the firm that you were paired with.
        You will also see how the inventory order quantities of the other
        participants were distributed.
