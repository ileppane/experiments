        Instructions for Part III
    </h3>

    <p>
        In this part of the study you again represent a firm that sells products from an inventory to customers.
        However, now there is also another firm selling almost the same product from its own inventory. We have paired you
        with a randomly chosen another participant who represents this other firm. This other participant is not the same as in Part I.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will remain anonymous to each other. The decision making situation
        is identical to both participants and both see the same instructions. You will again make a single decision about
        an inventory level that will determine your monetary reward from this part of the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>
            This part differs from the previous part in one essential way: if you have any unsatisfied demand, <b>that demand
            benefits the other firm</b>. Likewise, if the other firm has unsatisfied demand, that demand will flow to your
            inventory and benefit you. Therefore, any decision that you make may affect the other participant's profit,
            or any decision that the other participant makes may affect your profit. This is all described below in detail.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your <b>order</b> of units to the inventory can be any whole number between 1 and 100.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Industry demand</b> is split in half, and each half forms the <b>initial allocation</b> of demand for each firm.
    </p>

    <p> The industry demand is randomly drawn as an even number between 2 and 200. Each value of industry demand has an
        equal probability of occurring.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Important</b>: The industry demand is always split in half to form the initial allocations of the two firms.
        This means that you and the other firm will always face the same number of customers coming to your inventories.
        For example, if industry demand is 130 units, initial allocation of demand for each firm is 65 units.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a firm's inventory level is below the initial allocation, 80% of the extra demand will flow to the other firm's inventory;
        this type of demand is called <strong>reallocated demand</strong>. However, a firm's reallocated demand will go to the other firm
        <i>only if</i> the other firm has a higher inventory level to accommodate the reallocation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Effective demand</b> at one inventory will consist of the initial allocation +
        reallocation from the other inventory. You will know the industry demand and the effective demands of
        both firms only after both have made the decisions on how much to order.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Revenue</b>. Your revenue will be determined by how many units you are able to sell to your customers, in a similar manner
        as in Part II. However, now your revenue is determined by the effective demand.
        If the effective demand is higher than your inventory level, then your revenue is determined only by the amount that is
        in your inventory. If the effective demand is lower than your inventory level, then your revenue is determined only by
        the amount that is demanded. The customers will pay 4 pence (£ 1/100) per each unit that is sold from the inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if your inventory level is 40, but your initial demand is 60, then there are 20 customers who will leave
        your inventory empty handed. 80% of these 20 customers, or 16 customers, will be reallocated to
        the other firm's inventory if its inventory level is greater than your inventory level of 40. Thus, in this example
        reallocated demand from your inventory to the other firm's inventory is 16, indicating an effective demand of 60 + 16 = 76
        at the other firm's inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Likewise, if there are customers at the other firm's inventory that the other firm cannot satisfy, 80% of them will
        be reallocated from its inventory to your inventory if your inventory level is higher than that in the other firm's inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Ordering cost</b>. You will have to pay 2 pence for each unit that you order to the inventory. Note that due
        to the randomness of demand, it may be that your ordering cost will be higher than your revenue, resulting into losses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your profit, measured in pence (£ 1/100), is therefore:
    </p>

    <ul>
        If effective demand is less than ordered units: <b>4 × [effective demand] &minus; 2 × [ordered units]</b><br>
        If effective demand is more than ordered units: <b>4 × [ordered units] &minus; 2 × [ordered units]</b><br>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If your inventory level is greater than the other's inventory level, your effective demand is calculated as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <b>[initial allocation] +  0.8 × [unsatisfied demand at the other firm's inventory]</b>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Otherwise your effective demand equals your initial allocation. The calculation of effective demand is identical for the other firm.
    </p>

    <p>
        If losses occur, these will be subtracted from your baseline reward.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you make your decision, you are provided a profit calculator that you can use to calculate the profit for
        any combination of ordered units and demand.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Monetary reward</b>. You will be paid the average of the two profits that you get from this part and Part II.
        For example, if your profit in this part is 120 pence and in Part II, 90 pence, your monetary reward is
        (0.90 + 1.20)/2 = £1.05. This will be added to your reward from Part I.
    </p>

        For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this study.
