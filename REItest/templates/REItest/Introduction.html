<p>Thank you for participating in this online experiment. The whole experiment contains three parts. You will be given £5 at the beginning of the Part 2 and the Part 3 (£10 total). Moreover, you will have the chance to earn more by investing the money we assign to you. Specific instructions will be given later.</p>

<p>To note, all the monetary values in this experiment will be represented in a fictitious currency “Experiment Dollar”, denoted by “$”. Its exchange rate with Pound Sterling is 5 to 1, i.e. $5 = £1.</p>

<p>To begin with the Part 1, there are two sections. Section 1 consists of eleven multiple-choice questions that vary in difficulty, and section 2 is a short survey.</p>
