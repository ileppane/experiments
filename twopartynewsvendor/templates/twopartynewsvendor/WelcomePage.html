<h2>Task description</h2>
<p>Your task in this part of the study is to make a number of decisions under uncertainty in a simple inventory management setting.</p>
<p>You are a retailer who sells a single (fictional) item at a specic market price to customers. You order these items to an inventory before you can sell them. You order the items from the supplier at a specific unit cost and your customers will pay a specific unit price for them. You must make the order decision before you know how many items your customers will demand.</p>
<p>Even though you do not know the demand at the time of making your decision, you known what are the possible demand values. You also know that each demand value will occur equally likely.</p>
<p>This situation repeats in the same manner over many selling rounds. The nature of the items is such that you cannot carry them over to the next round.</p>

<p>The profit from your chosen order quantity depends on the realization of the random demand. Unless the realized demand exactly matches your order quantity, there are two possibilities:
<ul>
    <li>The demand is higher than your order quantity; in this case you will disappoint some of your customers because you cannot deliver the items to them, and you will also lose any margin from those units of demand you could not satisfy.</li>
    <li>The demand is lower than your order quantity; in this case you satisfy your customers, but you have incurred costs for some units bought, without being able to earn revenue with these units.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to calculate the prospective profits for each possible combination of order quantity and demand. They are provided to you by means of a decision matrix:</p>

<br>

<div id="tabledata"></div>

<h2>Experimental protocol</h2>
<p>You will first answer to some test questions at the end of this page. Then you have to make order decisions in a number of rounds. In each round, you have the choice among a set of possible order quantities, and you make these decisions in the decision matrix as given above. After each decision, the computer randomly determines a demand realization. The profits to you and your customer resulting from your order quantity and the realized demand is displayed. Then the computer guides you to the next decision round.</p><p>As in Part 1, you should make sound decisions, because you will be rewarded according to them.</p>

<h2>Reward determination</h2>
<p>You will either receive the reward from your inventory profits as determined below in Option 1, or the reward from customer profits determined by another subject's choices who participates in this study at the same time, as described in Option 2 below. The computer will randomly decide which one of these options will take place, and both have equal probability to occur.</p>
<p>Option 1: To determine your actual monetary reward from this part, at the end of the experiment the computer will calculate the average profits for you and your customer over all the rounds and divide them by 10. This will be your monetary reward from Part 2 in pence (i.e. in £ 1/100). For example, if your average profit over all the rounds is 897, your monetary reward from this part is £0.90 (rounded to the nearest whole pence).</p>
<p>Option 2: The computer will choose you a partner and calculate the average customer profits from his or her decisions over all the rounds. This will be divided by 10 and this will be your monetary reward from Part 2 in pence.</p>
<p>In addition to your rewards from the tasks in Parts 1 and 2, you will receive a baseline reward of £{{ baselinereward }}.</p>
<h2>Test questions</h2>
<p>Please answer the following questions concerning the task. We just want to make sure that you have understood the above instructions correctly.</p>
